# pomodash
This is a 'pomodoro' timer app with a data dashboard using python and dash.plotly.
I created this as part of my coursework at Spiced Data Science Bootcamp and it is work in progress.
Currently the following components exist:
1. A CLI pomodoro timer app that will record pomodoro sessions and write them to a txt file.
2. A synthetic pomodoro data generator for testing the dashboard application.
3. A dashboard application made with Dash showing total pomodoros over a time period and per month / task.
